# EditorTrees
#### Data Structures &amp; Algorithm Analysis Class Project - Spring 2014

In this project we wrote methods that could be the "behind the scenes" data structure used by a text editor. Each piece of text was represented as a height-balanced tree with ranks with each node containing a single character. Additonally, each method had a specific running time constraint to be in accordance with expected efficiency. .
